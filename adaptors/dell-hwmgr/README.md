# dell-hwmgr

The Dell Hardware Manager Adaptor for O-Cloud Hardware Manager Plugin provides the interactions between the O-Cloud
Manager and one or more configured Dell Hardware Managers.

## Overview

The Dell Hardware Manager Adaptor requires the `.spec.dellData` field to be set in the `HardwareManager` CR, providing
the necessary configuration information to establish an authenticated connection to the hardware manager instance. The
Plugin will interact with the hardware manager while processing a `NodePool` CR.

## Configuration

The `dellData` of the `HardwareManager` CR provides the following information:

- apiUrl: The address for the hardware manager.
- authSecret: The name of the secret in the Plugin namespace that provides the username and password to be used when
  requesting a token.

The secret follows the `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` type format, with `username` and `password` data fields, along with the `client-id` field.

Example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: dell-1
  namespace: oran-hwmgr-plugin
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
data:
  client-id: bXljbGllbnQ=
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: bm90cmVhbA==
---
apiVersion: hwmgr-plugin.oran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: HardwareManager
metadata:
  name: dell-1
  namespace: oran-hwmgr-plugin
spec:
  adaptorId: dell-hwmgr
  dellData:
    authSecret: dell-1
    apiUrl: https://myserver.example.com:443/
```

If the Plugin is able to establish an authenticated connection to the hardware manager, a `Validation` condition is set
to True on the `HardwareManager` CR to indicate that the CR has been validated and authentication was successful. If
not, the `Validation` field is set to False with a message indicating that authentication has failed.
